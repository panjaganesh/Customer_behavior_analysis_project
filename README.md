# Customer_behavior_analysis_project
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow — from loading raw data in Python to building a fully interactive Power BI dashboard.
It highlights my ability to clean data, explore insights, write SQL queries, visualize results, and present findings professionally through reports and a Gamma-generated PPT.

📁 Dataset
Source: Public/Provided dataset (CSV format)
Content: Includes multiple fields such as customer details, transactions, dates, and categorical/numerical variables.
Purpose: To analyze patterns, identify trends, and generate actionable insights.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Programming & Data Processing
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook
Database
PostgreSQL / MySQL
SQL (Joins, Aggregations, Window Functions)
Visualization & Reporting
Power BI
Gamma (AI-based presentation)
Other Tools
Git / GitHub for version control

📌 Project Steps
1️⃣ Load & Understand the Dataset
Import dataset using Python
Display shape, info, datatypes
Identify missing values & duplicates
2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Summary statistics
Distribution plots (histograms, boxplots)
Correlation analysis
Detect outliers and patterns
3️⃣ Data Cleaning
Handle missing values
Remove duplicates
Fix incorrect data types
Standardize/transform columns as required
4️⃣ SQL Database Integration
Import cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL/MySQL
Run SQL queries for:
Filtering & sorting
Grouping & aggregations
Window functions (if applicable)
Joins and subqueries
Validate insights against Python analysis
5️⃣ Power BI Dashboard
Connect to database or cleaned dataset
Create interactive visuals such as:
KPIs (Totals, Averages, YoY metric)
Bar/Line/Pie charts
Slicers for filters
Build a clean, professional dashboard layout
6️⃣ Reporting & Presentation
Write a concise summary report covering:
Business problem
Key insights
Data trends
Recommendations
Create an AI-powered PPT using Gamma for presentation-ready storytelling.

📊 Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard includes:
High-level KPIs
Trend analysis
Category-wise performance
Drilldowns for deeper insights
Fully interactive filters
